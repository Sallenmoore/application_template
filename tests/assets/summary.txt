In the absurd theater of life, a dog was found dead at midnight, impaled by a garden fork on Mrs Shears' lawn. The dog, in a tragicomic twist, appeared to be running in its sleep, a dream chase turned nightmare. The narrator, in a display of morbid curiosity, deduced the fork as the likely murder weapon, dismissing the possibility of post-mortem impalement following a cancer diagnosis or a car crash. The certainty of the dog's death was the only certainty in this farcical tableau.
