The story begins at seven minutes past midnight, where a dog is found dead on the lawn of Mrs Shears' house. The dog, lying as if in mid-run or sleep, has a garden fork protruding from its body, presumably the cause of its death. There don't appear to be any other injuries on the dog, leading the narrator to rule out causes such as cancer or a road accident, though they acknowledge the uncertainty of this conclusion.
