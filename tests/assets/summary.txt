In the absurd theater of life, a dog finds itself impaled on a garden fork, frozen in a dream-like run, at the stroke of midnight. The dog, now a tragic lawn ornament in front of Mrs Shears' house, is dead, presumably from the fork, because who would bother to stab a dog post-mortem? Yet, the narrator can't be sure, highlighting the futility of seeking certainty in a world where dogs can end up as cutlery holders.
