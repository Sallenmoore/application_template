A dog was found dead in the middle of Mrs Shears' lawn just after midnight, appearing as though it were running in its sleep. However, a garden fork was impaled through the dog, going deep enough to reach the ground and stay upright. Upon examination, no other wounds were visible on the dog, leading to the assumption that the garden fork was likely the cause of death. Other potential causes like a disease or accident were dismissed, given the unusual presence of the fork. However, there was still some uncertainty regarding the exact cause of the dog's death.
