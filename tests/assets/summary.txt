In the absurd theater of life, a dog finds itself impaled on a garden fork at midnight, in a scene that could be mistaken for a bizarre dream sequence. The dog, seemingly frozen in a dreamy run, is in fact dead, with the fork acting as a morbid anchor to the earth. The narrator, in a display of dark humor, dismisses the possibility of post-mortem fork impalement, ruling out causes like cancer or a road accident. The certainty of the dog's cause of death remains as elusive as the meaning of life itself.
