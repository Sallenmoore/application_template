In the absurd theater of life, a dog finds itself impaled on a garden fork at midnight, mimicking the futile chase of a dream cat in its death pose. The protagonist, in a display of equally absurd logic, concludes that the fork is likely the murder weapon, dismissing the possibility of post-mortem fork insertion due to cancer or a road accident. The certainty of the dog's death is the only certainty in this bizarre tableau.
