In the absurd theater of life, a dog found itself impaled on a garden fork at the stroke of midnight, a spectacle as bizarre as it was tragic. The canine, frozen in a dream-like run, was not chasing imaginary cats but was, in fact, quite dead. The fork, defying gravity, was firmly lodged in the dog and the ground, suggesting a violent end rather than a peaceful departure due to cancer or a road accident. Yet, the certainty of this conclusion was as elusive as the meaning of existence itself.
