In the early minutes after midnight, a dog was found dead on the lawn in front of Mrs. Shears' house, appearing to be in a position as if it were chasing something in a dream. A garden fork was embedded in it, suggesting it was likely the cause of death since there were no visible wounds. The narrator concluded that it was improbable for the fork to be placed there after the dog had died, leaving the circumstances of its death in question.
