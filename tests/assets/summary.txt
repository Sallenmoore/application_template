The text describes a scene taking place just past midnight on Mrs. Shearsâ€™ lawn, where a dog is found dead. It's postured as if it is dreaming of running, however, it's clearly dead because a garden fork is impaled into it, sticking straight up, implying it was stabbed with enough force to penetrate through. The theory is formed that the dog was likely killed with the fork as there are no other visible wounds, and it's unlikely that the fork would have been impaled post-mortem. However, there is an element of uncertainty regarding the cause of death.
