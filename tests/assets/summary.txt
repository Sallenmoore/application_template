At a little past midnight, a dog was found dead on the lawn of Mrs Shears' house. The dog looked peaceful, as if it was dreaming and chasing a cat, but a closer look revealed a distressing truth. A garden fork was thrust into its body, its prongs pierced the animal so deeply that the other end stuck into the ground, keeping the fork upright. The absence of any other discernible wounds on the dog led to the conclusion that its death was caused by the fork. However, this was only a hypothesis, not a certainty. There was no guarantee that the dog hadn't died from another cause, such as disease or an accident before the fork was inserted.
